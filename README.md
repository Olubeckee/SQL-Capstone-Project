### The main goal of this case study is to help management make Informed Decision to Maximise Profit and Reduce Loss to the lowest Minimum

In order to Analyse and  communicate effectively with management so action can be made based on the insights generated, there is need to leverage on Programming Language tool like SQL applications. For this business case I leveraged on PostgreSql for my data analysis and Microsoft Excel for visualization.

## DATA UNDERSTANDING

## A Microsoft Excel Worksheet (csv) dataset was provided for analysis consisting of 1048 rows and 13 columns

The Data workbook consist of the Sales ID,	Sales Reps,	Emails,	Brands,	Plant Cost	Unit Price,	Quantity,	Cost,	Profit,	Countries	Region 	Months,	Years

From the overview of datasets displayed above, itâ€™s important and necessary we prepare the datasets before analysis and visualization is carried out.

## DATA PREPARATION

In preparing the Data, the First step taken was to Import the dataset from my Excel workbook into PgAdmin. I did that by Importing my dataset from excel into the Database i already created in the PgAdmin Environment.
This is how the Imported Dataset look like in the Pgadmin
